## [ABA Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem)

The ABA problem is a subtle challenge that can arise in multithreaded programming when dealing with shared memory. It occurs during synchronization, specifically when relying solely on a variable's current value to determine if data has been modified. 

The ABA problem occurs when multiple threads (or processes) accessing shared data interleave. Below is a sequence of events that illustrates the ABA problem:

1. Process $P_1$ reads value A from some shared memory location.

2. $P_1$ is preempted, allowing process $P_2$ to run.

3. $P_2$ writes value B to the shared memory location.

4. $P_2$ writes value A to the shared memory location.

5. $P_2$ is preempted, allowing process $P_1$ to run.

6. $P_1$ reads value A from the shared memory location.

7. $P_1$ determines that the shared memory value has not changed and continues.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <windows.h>

int shared = 0;

DWORD WINAPI thread_proc_1(void *_)
{
    int current = shared;

    // Mimic an operation
    Sleep(30);

    int now = shared;
    if (current != now)
    {
        std::cerr << current << " != " << now << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

DWORD WINAPI thread_proc_2(void *_)
{
    shared = 1;
    return 0;
}

int main()
{
    HANDLE thread_1 = CreateThread(
        NULL,             // lpThreadAttributes
        0,                // dwStackSize
        &thread_proc_1,   // lpStartAddress
        NULL,             // lpParameter
        CREATE_SUSPENDED, // dwCreationFlags
        NULL              // lpThreadId
    );
    HANDLE thread_2 = CreateThread(NULL, 0, &thread_proc_2, NULL, CREATE_SUSPENDED, NULL);

    ResumeThread(thread_1);
    ResumeThread(thread_2);

    WaitForSingleObject(thread_1, INFINITE);
    WaitForSingleObject(thread_2, INFINITE);

    CloseHandle(thread_1);
    CloseHandle(thread_2);

    return 0;
}
```

Running the example above multiple times will randomly print `0 != 1` to the standard error. It is worth noted that the problem wasn't caused by non-atomical operations - changing `int shared = 0;` to `std::atomic<int> shared(0);` will cause the identical problem. Rather, the ABA problem occurs at a higher level and is a result of poor algorithm design.

### Real-world implications

### Addressing the ABA Problem

Several approaches can help mitigate the ABA problem:

* **Timestamps:** By associating a version number or timestamp with the data, threads can ensure the value hasn't changed between reads. An inconsistency arises if the version retrieved during the second read doesn't match the version associated with the initial value.
* **Locking mechanisms:** Utilizing synchronization primitives like mutexes or spinlocks ensures exclusive access to the shared memory location during critical sections. This prevents other threads from modifying the data while the first thread is performing its read-modify-write operation.
* **Atomic operations:** In specific scenarios, employing atomic operations that combine read and write into a single, indivisible step can eliminate the window of vulnerability between reads. However, atomic operations might not be suitable for all situations.

By understanding the ABA problem and implementing appropriate synchronization techniques, developers can ensure the integrity of data in multithreaded environments.
